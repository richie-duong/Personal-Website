        <img src="images/profilepic.png" id="profile" alt="richard">
        <p>Originally from Atlanta, Georgia (United States) and currently attending Algonquin College in pursuit of
            obtaining
            a diploma in <b>Computer Programming</b>. <br><br> In my spare time, I enjoy making making digital art and
            graphical
            designs for an indie-game passion project I have been working on for quite some time. <br><br>
            I am hoping that my knowledge in art and programming will lead me to become a successful front-end web
            developer!

            <p>Below are just a few of the artworks I have done over the years. I love making art as an outlet, and I am
                hoping that I can say the same about coding after I complete this program. I am also hoping that my
                creativity would one day make me a stand-out programmer.</p>
